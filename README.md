# AMBA AHB-Lite Verilog Design

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of the **AMBA AHB-Lite (Advanced High-performance Bus Lite)** protocol, a simplified subset of the AMBA AHB protocol used in ARM-based SoCs. It is suitable for learning, simulation, and integration into custom SoC designs.

## ðŸ“– Protocol Overview

**AMBA AHB-Lite** is a high-performance, pipelined bus protocol designed for efficient communication between a single master and multiple slaves. Key features:
- Single master, multiple slave architecture
- 32/64-bit data buses
- Burst and single transfers
- Address and data phases are pipelined
- Ready/valid handshaking via `HREADY` and `HRESP`

## ðŸ“– Features
-Burst Transfers: Supports INCR4, WRAP4, INCR8, and other burst types.

-Configurable Slaves: Four slaves with 32-bit memory arrays.

-Error Handling: Slaves generate OKAY/ERROR responses.

-Parameterized Design: Configurable data/address widths
